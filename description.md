### Project Description

Explore an innovative platform that combines the realms of gaming and social networks on the blockchain. Our project leverages decentralized technology to enhance social gaming, starting with "Lenschess," an on-chain chess platform offering competitive play with blockchain transparency.

#### Importance of Games in Social Networks

Games are key to fostering community and engagement within social networks through shared experiences. As interactions transition to the blockchain, our platform supports players in showcasing their abilities, forming communities, and engaging in transparent discussions. Validated on-chain game results also open opportunities for more secure and auditable betting markets.

#### Potential of Social Credits

We envision a "social credits" system aimed at promoting fair play and creating fairer betting markets in the future. This system could highlight players with high social credibility, allowing the community to engage and bet confidently within a self-regulating ecosystem.

### About Lenschess: Innovating On-Chain Gaming

Lenschess, initially offers:

- A dynamic leaderboard with ELO ratings
- A straightforward player challenge system
- Game spectating and win claims on opponent timeouts

#### Roadmap and Integration

Our future plans include integrating with the Lens Protocol to enable:

- Tight integration into lens protocol's social features
- Push notifications for games via your preferred Lens client

- Implement (ZKSync's SSO)[https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso] for a smoother user experience.

This project seeks to merge social gaming with blockchain technology, fostering a community driven by skill, reputation, and passion. Join us as we iterate through pre-alpha to shape the future of decentralized social interaction and gaming.
